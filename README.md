# NClassForLinux
NClass v2.04 that will build on linux 

THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS NOTHING MORE THAN THE SOURCE CODE OF THE LAST VERSION OF NCLASS AS RELEASED BY Balazs Tihanyi. The projects home is at http://nclass.sourceforge.net/index.html . All I have done is manipulate the build files with a simple bash script so that the project will build under linux. To build the project all you need to do is run the NAnt command in the project folder. The script I created is in the root of the project as it might be of use for future releases as well.

FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF NCLASS AS CAN BE FOUND AT http://nclass.sourceforge.net/index.html

# Overview

NClass is a free tool to easily create UML class diagrams with full C# and Java language support. The user interface is designed to be simple and user-friendly for easy and fast development. Properties, enums, delegates and other language specific elements are fully supported with strict syntactical and semantical verification.

Design your application with just a few clicks - the main goal is to provide a simple but powerful class designer that is very intuitive to use. Diagram styles help you to create professional looking diagrams, just like in Visual Studio or other commercial products. Furthermore, you can generate code from your models or you can also import classes from existing .NET assemblies.

Please note, NClass is far from complete. There are many missing features that are planned for future versions. But if you have an idea, please share your thoughts in one of the way listed on the support page.
